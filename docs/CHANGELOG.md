# Threadology — Changelog

---

## [2026-03-31] — Project Scaffold

### Added
- Next.js 14 project with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint
- shadcn/ui initialized (v4.1.1, uses `@base-ui/react` under the hood)
- Route groups: `(auth)` for login/signup, `(main)` for vault and fit pages
- Placeholder pages: `/login`, `/signup`, `/vault`, `/fit/new`, `/fit/[slug]`
- `components/ui/button.tsx` from shadcn, `lib/utils.ts` cn() helper
- `types/index.ts` with initial User, GarmentItem, Fit interfaces
- Git initialized with initial commit

### Notes
- `next/font/google` does not export Geist/Geist_Mono in this environment — using local VF font files instead
- shadcn v4 button uses `@base-ui/react` not `@radix-ui/react-slot`, so `asChild` prop is not available; use `<Link>` directly for nav buttons

## [2026-03-31] — Supabase Integration & Database Schema

### Added
- `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr` installed
- `lib/supabase.ts` — browser `createClient` for Client Components
- `lib/supabase-server.ts` — async `createServerClient` with SSR cookie handling for Server Components / Route Handlers / Server Actions
- `types/database.ts` — hand-written typed `Database` interface for all four tables
- `supabase/schema.sql` — full schema:
  - `fit_visibility` enum (`private`, `link_only`, `public`)
  - Tables: `users`, `pieces`, `fits`, `fit_pieces`
  - `updated_at` trigger on `pieces` and `fits`
  - `handle_new_user` trigger auto-creates `users` profile on `auth.users` insert
- Row Level Security on all tables: owners get full CRUD; public can read `link_only`/`public` fits and their associated pieces
- `.env.local.example` with env var template

### Fixed
- Split `lib/supabase.ts` into browser and server files — `next/headers` (server-only) was co-located with browser client, which would bundle server code into Client Components

### Notes
- Hand-written `Database` type must include `Relationships: []` on every table and `Views`/`Functions` on the schema — required by `GenericTable` / `GenericSchema` in `@supabase/postgrest-js`. Missing fields cause all `.update()` calls to resolve to `never`.

## [2026-03-31] — Authentication Forms

### Added
- `components/auth/auth-form.tsx` — shared `AuthForm` card wrapper, `FormField`, `SubmitButton` primitives
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — email/password login wired to `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`, inline error display, loading state, redirects to `/vault`
- `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` — username/email/password signup with:
  - Client-side validation (username regex `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,30}`, password min 8 chars)
  - Username availability pre-check against `public.users`
  - Username passed via `options.data` so `handle_new_user` trigger uses it directly
  - Ghost-user detection (Supabase returns empty `identities[]` for duplicate emails)
  - Fallback `users.update()` for when email confirmation is enabled

### Notes
- Supabase auth color palette: cream `#F5F1EA` background, `#FDFCFA` inputs, `#E0D8CC` borders, `#2D5A45`/`#1E3D2F` primary button

---

## [2026-03-31] — Route Protection & Main Layout

### Added
- `middleware.ts` — session refresh + route guards using `@supabase/ssr`:
  - Protected: `/vault*`, `/fit/new`, `/fit/*/edit`, `/fit/[slug]`
  - Auth-only (redirect to `/vault` if signed in): `/login`, `/signup`
  - Public: `/`, `/fit/*/*`
- `lib/auth.ts` — server helpers: `getUser()`, `requireUser()`, `getUserProfile()`
- `lib/actions/auth.ts` — `signOut()` server action (clears session cookie, redirects to `/login`)
- `components/layout/user-menu.tsx` — avatar/initial trigger button, click-outside dropdown with username header, vault/fit links, sign-out form action
- `app/(main)/layout.tsx` — sticky cream header with Threadology wordmark and `UserMenu`; calls `requireUser()` for dual auth protection; wraps children in `max-w-5xl` container

### Notes
- Middleware must always return the same `supabaseResponse` object that was built in `setAll` — returning a different `NextResponse` drops the refreshed session cookies
- Dual protection: middleware handles redirect for unauthenticated users; layout calls `requireUser()` as a belt-and-suspenders guard

---

## [2026-03-31] — Storage & Photo Upload

### Added
- `supabase/storage-setup.sql` — creates `images` bucket (5 MB limit, JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF), four storage RLS policies keyed on `storage.foldername(name)[1] = auth.uid()`
- `lib/storage.ts` — `uploadImage(file, userId)`, `deleteImage(url)`, `getPublicUrl(path)` helpers; client-side file validation; path extraction from public URL for delete
- `components/vault/photo-upload.tsx` — multi-file upload with per-photo state (uploading spinner, error overlay, remove button, drag-to-reorder); uploads immediately on selection; `onUploadingChange` callback gates parent submit
- `components/vault/add-piece-form.tsx` — full add-piece client form: brand/type required, all other fields optional; submit disabled and shows "Uploading photos…" spinner while any upload in progress
- `app/(main)/vault/add/page.tsx` — server page passing `user.id` to the form
- `app/(main)/vault/page.tsx` — initial piece grid with empty state

### Notes
- `contentType: file.type` must be passed to the storage upload call or Supabase defaults to `application/octet-stream`, breaking image display
- `deleteImage(url)` parses the storage path by splitting on `/object/public/images/` — brittle if the project URL or bucket name changes

## [2026-03-31] — Tailwind + CSS Fix

### Fixed
- `globals.css` was generated with Tailwind v4 syntax (`@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"`, `@apply border-border outline-ring/50`) but project uses Tailwind v3
- Removed `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` (v4-only)
- Replaced `@apply border-border outline-ring/50` with direct CSS using `color-mix()` for the opacity
- Added full shadcn color mapping to `tailwind.config.ts` (`border`, `ring`, `muted`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `card`, `popover`, `destructive`, `input`) so all shadcn utility classes resolve

### Notes
- Tailwind v3 cannot apply opacity modifiers (`/50`) to colors defined as plain `var()` — opacity modifiers require `hsl(var(--x) / <alpha-value>)` channel format or direct `color-mix()` in CSS

---

## [2026-03-31] — Vault Display & Piece Detail

### Added
- IBM Plex Mono and Cormorant Garamond loaded via Google Fonts `<link>` in root layout; registered in Tailwind as `font-mono-display` and `font-serif`
- `components/vault/piece-card.tsx` — square photo thumbnail, brand in IBM Plex Mono (uppercase, tracking-widest), name/type in Cormorant Garamond serif, year; hover lift (`-translate-y-0.5`) + photo scale (`scale-[1.03]`); placeholder shirt SVG when no photos
- `components/vault/vault-grid.tsx` — responsive `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`
- `components/vault/empty-vault.tsx` — Lucide `Shirt` icon, serif headline, green CTA to `/vault/add`
- `app/(main)/vault/page.tsx` — "Your Vault" serif title, stats row (piece count · unique brand count), renders `VaultGrid` or `EmptyVault`
- `app/(main)/vault/[id]/page.tsx` — piece detail: two-column layout with full photo gallery + metadata grid (empty fields omitted) + story; `notFound()` if piece doesn't belong to current user

### Changed
- Renamed `/vault/new` → `/vault/add` to match spec

### Notes
- `next/font/google` does not resolve named exports (IBM_Plex_Mono, Cormorant_Garamond) at runtime in this environment — Google Fonts loaded via `<link>` as a workaround
- Piece detail uses `.eq("user_id", user.id)` at the query level in addition to RLS for defence in depth

---

## [2026-04-02] — Piece Detail Page

### Added
- `components/vault/photo-gallery.tsx` — client component with selected-photo state; large primary image swaps on thumbnail click; thumbnail strip hidden when only one photo; active thumbnail gets forest green ring
- `components/vault/delete-piece-modal.tsx` — confirmation dialog with backdrop blur; shows piece name in confirmation copy; destructive red Delete button; loading/error states; redirects to `/vault` on success
- `lib/actions/pieces.ts` — added `deletePiece(pieceId)` server action; scoped to `user_id` for defence in depth on top of RLS

### Changed
- `app/(main)/vault/[id]/page.tsx` — full redesign of piece detail:
  - Back chevron link to vault
  - `PhotoGallery` client component replaces static images
  - Brand in IBM Plex Mono (uppercase, tracking-widest); name/type in Cormorant Garamond serif at `text-3xl`; year · season in gray below
  - Metadata 2-col grid (type, size, condition, year, season — empty fields omitted)
  - Story rendered as `<blockquote>` with `#2D5A45` left border, serif italic
  - Owner-only Edit link + Delete modal below details

### Notes
- `isOwner` guard derived from `piece.user_id === user.id` client-side (redundant with `.eq("user_id", user.id)` in the query, but explicit for future public-viewing mode)
- `deletePiece` does not delete associated Storage files — orphaned images remain in the bucket; clean-up can be added when edit flow is built

---

## [2026-04-02] — Automated CHANGELOG & Commit Hook

### Added
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with full project history from day one
- `.claude/settings.local.json` Stop hook: after every Claude response, injects a checklist reminder into Claude's context to (1) append to CHANGELOG.md and (2) run `git add . && git commit && git push`
- `Bash(git push:*)` added to the local settings allow list so push runs without a permission prompt

### Notes
- The Stop hook uses `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` — invisible in the UI, but injects the reminder into Claude's model context after every turn
- `settings.local.json` is gitignored (personal overrides); hook only applies to this machine

## [2026-04-02] — README

### Changed
- Replaced the default create-next-app README with a project overview covering what Threadology does, the tech stack, project structure, getting-started steps, and database/storage schema summary

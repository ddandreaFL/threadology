# Threadology — Changelog

---

## [2026-03-31] — Project Scaffold

### Added
- Next.js 14 project with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint
- shadcn/ui initialized (v4.1.1, uses `@base-ui/react` under the hood)
- Route groups: `(auth)` for login/signup, `(main)` for vault and fit pages
- Placeholder pages: `/login`, `/signup`, `/vault`, `/fit/new`, `/fit/[slug]`
- `components/ui/button.tsx` from shadcn, `lib/utils.ts` cn() helper
- `types/index.ts` with initial User, GarmentItem, Fit interfaces
- Git initialized with initial commit

### Notes
- `next/font/google` does not export Geist/Geist_Mono in this environment — using local VF font files instead
- shadcn v4 button uses `@base-ui/react` not `@radix-ui/react-slot`, so `asChild` prop is not available; use `<Link>` directly for nav buttons

---

## [2026-03-31] — Supabase Integration & Database Schema

### Added
- `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr` installed
- `lib/supabase.ts` — browser `createClient` for Client Components
- `lib/supabase-server.ts` — async `createServerClient` with SSR cookie handling for Server Components / Route Handlers / Server Actions
- `types/database.ts` — hand-written typed `Database` interface for all four tables
- `supabase/schema.sql` — full schema:
  - `fit_visibility` enum (`private`, `link_only`, `public`)
  - Tables: `users`, `pieces`, `fits`, `fit_pieces`
  - `updated_at` trigger on `pieces` and `fits`
  - `handle_new_user` trigger auto-creates `users` profile on `auth.users` insert
- Row Level Security on all tables: owners get full CRUD; public can read `link_only`/`public` fits and their associated pieces
- `.env.local.example` with env var template

### Fixed
- Split `lib/supabase.ts` into browser and server files — `next/headers` (server-only) was co-located with browser client, which would bundle server code into Client Components

### Notes
- Hand-written `Database` type must include `Relationships: []` on every table and `Views`/`Functions` on the schema — required by `GenericTable` / `GenericSchema` in `@supabase/postgrest-js`. Missing fields cause all `.update()` calls to resolve to `never`.

---

## [2026-03-31] — Authentication Forms

### Added
- `components/auth/auth-form.tsx` — shared `AuthForm` card wrapper, `FormField`, `SubmitButton` primitives
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — email/password login wired to `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`, inline error display, loading state, redirects to `/vault`
- `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` — username/email/password signup with:
  - Client-side validation (username regex `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,30}`, password min 8 chars)
  - Username availability pre-check against `public.users`
  - Username passed via `options.data` so `handle_new_user` trigger uses it directly
  - Ghost-user detection (Supabase returns empty `identities[]` for duplicate emails)
  - Fallback `users.update()` for when email confirmation is enabled

### Notes
- Supabase auth color palette: cream `#F5F1EA` background, `#FDFCFA` inputs, `#E0D8CC` borders, `#2D5A45`/`#1E3D2F` primary button

---

## [2026-03-31] — Route Protection & Main Layout

### Added
- `middleware.ts` — session refresh + route guards using `@supabase/ssr`:
  - Protected: `/vault*`, `/fit/new`, `/fit/*/edit`, `/fit/[slug]`
  - Auth-only (redirect to `/vault` if signed in): `/login`, `/signup`
  - Public: `/`, `/fit/*/*`
- `lib/auth.ts` — server helpers: `getUser()`, `requireUser()`, `getUserProfile()`
- `lib/actions/auth.ts` — `signOut()` server action (clears session cookie, redirects to `/login`)
- `components/layout/user-menu.tsx` — avatar/initial trigger button, click-outside dropdown with username header, vault/fit links, sign-out form action
- `app/(main)/layout.tsx` — sticky cream header with Threadology wordmark and `UserMenu`; calls `requireUser()` for dual auth protection; wraps children in `max-w-5xl` container

### Notes
- Middleware must always return the same `supabaseResponse` object that was built in `setAll` — returning a different `NextResponse` drops the refreshed session cookies
- Dual protection: middleware handles redirect for unauthenticated users; layout calls `requireUser()` as a belt-and-suspenders guard

---

## [2026-03-31] — Storage & Photo Upload

### Added
- `supabase/storage-setup.sql` — creates `images` bucket (5 MB limit, JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF), four storage RLS policies keyed on `storage.foldername(name)[1] = auth.uid()`
- `lib/storage.ts` — `uploadImage(file, userId)`, `deleteImage(url)`, `getPublicUrl(path)` helpers; client-side file validation; path extraction from public URL for delete
- `components/vault/photo-upload.tsx` — multi-file upload with per-photo state (uploading spinner, error overlay, remove button, drag-to-reorder); uploads immediately on selection; `onUploadingChange` callback gates parent submit
- `components/vault/add-piece-form.tsx` — full add-piece client form: brand/type required, all other fields optional; submit disabled and shows "Uploading photos…" spinner while any upload in progress
- `app/(main)/vault/add/page.tsx` — server page passing `user.id` to the form
- `app/(main)/vault/page.tsx` — initial piece grid with empty state

### Notes
- `contentType: file.type` must be passed to the storage upload call or Supabase defaults to `application/octet-stream`, breaking image display
- `deleteImage(url)` parses the storage path by splitting on `/object/public/images/` — brittle if the project URL or bucket name changes

---

## [2026-03-31] — Tailwind + CSS Fix

### Fixed
- `globals.css` was generated with Tailwind v4 syntax (`@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"`, `@apply border-border outline-ring/50`) but project uses Tailwind v3
- Removed `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` (v4-only)
- Replaced `@apply border-border outline-ring/50` with direct CSS using `color-mix()` for the opacity
- Added full shadcn color mapping to `tailwind.config.ts` (`border`, `ring`, `muted`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `card`, `popover`, `destructive`, `input`) so all shadcn utility classes resolve

### Notes
- Tailwind v3 cannot apply opacity modifiers (`/50`) to colors defined as plain `var()` — opacity modifiers require `hsl(var(--x) / <alpha-value>)` channel format or direct `color-mix()` in CSS

---

## [2026-03-31] — Vault Display & Piece Detail

### Added
- IBM Plex Mono and Cormorant Garamond loaded via Google Fonts `<link>` in root layout; registered in Tailwind as `font-mono-display` and `font-serif`
- `components/vault/piece-card.tsx` — square photo thumbnail, brand in IBM Plex Mono (uppercase, tracking-widest), name/type in Cormorant Garamond serif, year; hover lift (`-translate-y-0.5`) + photo scale (`scale-[1.03]`); placeholder shirt SVG when no photos
- `components/vault/vault-grid.tsx` — responsive `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`
- `components/vault/empty-vault.tsx` — Lucide `Shirt` icon, serif headline, green CTA to `/vault/add`
- `app/(main)/vault/page.tsx` — "Your Vault" serif title, stats row (piece count · unique brand count), renders `VaultGrid` or `EmptyVault`
- `app/(main)/vault/[id]/page.tsx` — piece detail: two-column layout with full photo gallery + metadata grid (empty fields omitted) + story; `notFound()` if piece doesn't belong to current user

### Changed
- Renamed `/vault/new` → `/vault/add` to match spec

### Notes
- `next/font/google` does not resolve named exports (IBM_Plex_Mono, Cormorant_Garamond) at runtime in this environment — Google Fonts loaded via `<link>` as a workaround
- Piece detail uses `.eq("user_id", user.id)` at the query level in addition to RLS for defence in depth

---

## [2026-04-02] — Piece Detail Page

### Added
- `components/vault/photo-gallery.tsx` — client component with selected-photo state; large primary image swaps on thumbnail click; thumbnail strip hidden when only one photo; active thumbnail gets forest green ring
- `components/vault/delete-piece-modal.tsx` — confirmation dialog with backdrop blur; shows piece name in confirmation copy; destructive red Delete button; loading/error states; redirects to `/vault` on success
- `lib/actions/pieces.ts` — added `deletePiece(pieceId)` server action; scoped to `user_id` for defence in depth on top of RLS

### Changed
- `app/(main)/vault/[id]/page.tsx` — full redesign of piece detail:
  - Back chevron link to vault
  - `PhotoGallery` client component replaces static images
  - Brand in IBM Plex Mono (uppercase, tracking-widest); name/type in Cormorant Garamond serif at `text-3xl`; year · season in gray below
  - Metadata 2-col grid (type, size, condition, year, season — empty fields omitted)
  - Story rendered as `<blockquote>` with `#2D5A45` left border, serif italic
  - Owner-only Edit link + Delete modal below details

### Notes
- `isOwner` guard derived from `piece.user_id === user.id` client-side (redundant with `.eq("user_id", user.id)` in the query, but explicit for future public-viewing mode)
- `deletePiece` does not delete associated Storage files — orphaned images remain in the bucket; clean-up can be added when edit flow is built

---

## [2026-04-02] — Automated CHANGELOG & Commit Hook

### Added
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with full project history from day one
- `.claude/settings.local.json` Stop hook: after every Claude response, injects a checklist reminder into Claude's context to (1) append to CHANGELOG.md and (2) run `git add . && git commit && git push`
- `Bash(git push:*)` added to the local settings allow list so push runs without a permission prompt

### Notes
- The Stop hook uses `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` — invisible in the UI, but injects the reminder into Claude's model context after every turn
- `settings.local.json` is gitignored (personal overrides); hook only applies to this machine

---

## [2026-04-03] — Create Fit Flow

### Added
- `lib/actions/fits.ts` — `createFit(data)` server action: inserts `fits` row + all `fit_pieces` rows, returns `{ username, slug }` for client-side redirect
- `components/fit/piece-slot.tsx` — slot component; empty state shows dashed border + add icon; filled state shows thumbnail (with `crop_positions` applied), brand in IBM Plex Mono, piece name, drag handle, and × remove button
- `components/fit/piece-selector.tsx` — bottom-sheet modal (full-screen on mobile, centered on sm+); live search by brand/type/name; 3-col thumbnail grid; already-selected pieces shown with green checkmark and disabled; "Add a new piece to your vault" footer link
- `components/fit/fit-form.tsx` — client component managing all form state: photos (up to 3 via `PhotoUpload`), piece slots (start 4, expandable), drag-to-reorder slots, title/caption/date/location fields, real-time preview URL, submit validation (≥1 photo + ≥1 piece), redirects to `/fit/[username]/[slug]` on success
- `app/(main)/fit/new/page.tsx` — server page: fetches user profile + vault pieces in parallel, renders `FitForm`

### Notes
- `generateSlug` in `FitForm`: slugifies title if provided, falls back to `fit-YYYY-MM-DD`; used for both the live preview URL and the submitted slug
- Slug uniqueness is enforced by the DB; a duplicate-slug error surfaces as a form error message
- Fit visibility defaults to `link_only` on creation
- `layer_order` = slot index of filled pieces after nulls are filtered out

---

## [2026-04-03] — Carousel Slide Animation & Edit Piece Page

### Added
- `app/(main)/vault/[id]/edit/page.tsx` — edit piece page; fetches piece server-side, guards with `requireUser()` + `.eq("user_id", user.id)`, renders `EditPieceForm`
- `components/vault/edit-piece-form.tsx` — pre-populated edit form; calls `updatePiece` server action on submit; Cancel link returns to piece detail
- `lib/actions/pieces.ts` — `updatePiece(pieceId, data)` server action; scoped to `user_id`; redirects to `/vault/[id]` on success

### Fixed
- Photo gallery white flash on navigation: replaced opacity-fade with CSS slide animation — outgoing image slides out while incoming slides in simultaneously (no background visible)
- Edit piece button 404: `/vault/[id]/edit` route now exists

### Changed
- `app/globals.css` — added `carousel-in-right`, `carousel-in-left`, `carousel-out-left`, `carousel-out-right` keyframes and corresponding `animate-carousel-*` utility classes
- `components/vault/photo-gallery.tsx` — carousel now tracks `prev`/`direction`/`transitioning` state; both outgoing and incoming images are absolutely positioned and animate simultaneously; `key` props ensure CSS animations restart on each transition

### Notes
- Carousel animation duration is 300ms ease-in-out; touch swipe threshold remains 50px
- Both images are rendered during the 300ms transition window, then the outgoing image is unmounted

---

## [2026-04-03] — Swipe Gallery & Image Repositioning

### Added
- `components/vault/image-adjuster.tsx` — drag-to-reposition modal: pointer-captured drag updates `object-position` in real time; calculates per-axis sensitivity from natural image dimensions so drag feels 1:1 regardless of portrait/landscape ratio; calls `updateCropPositions` server action on Save
- `supabase/migrations/add_crop_positions.sql` — `ALTER TABLE pieces ADD COLUMN crop_positions jsonb DEFAULT '{}'`

### Changed
- `components/vault/photo-gallery.tsx` — full rewrite:
  - Touch swipe (left→next, right→prev) with 50px threshold
  - Smooth opacity fade (120ms) between photos
  - Dot indicators overlaid at bottom of primary image; tappable to jump to photo
  - Desktop prev/next arrow buttons; hidden until hover (`group-hover:opacity-100`)
  - `cropPositions` prop applied via `object-position` on primary image and thumbnails
  - Owner-only "Reposition photo" button below the image; opens `ImageAdjuster` modal
  - Optimistic local update of `cropPositions` after a successful save
- `app/(main)/vault/[id]/page.tsx` — passes `cropPositions`, `pieceId`, `isOwner` to `PhotoGallery`
- `app/(main)/vault/page.tsx` — adds `crop_positions` to piece select query
- `components/vault/vault-grid.tsx` — adds `crop_positions` to Piece Pick type
- `components/vault/piece-card.tsx` — applies `object-position` on cover photo from `crop_positions["0"]`
- `types/database.ts` — adds `crop_positions: Record<string, { x: number; y: number }> | null` to pieces Row/Insert/Update
- `lib/actions/pieces.ts` — adds `updateCropPositions(pieceId, cropPositions)` server action

### Notes
- Run `supabase/migrations/add_crop_positions.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor before deploying
- Drag sensitivity is calculated from natural image dimensions on load; square images (no overflow) correctly show 0 sensitivity (nothing to reposition)
- `object-position` percentages stored as `{ x, y }` where 50/50 = center (CSS default)

---

## [2026-04-03] — Vercel Deployment & Security Audit

### Fixed
- Vercel build was deploying old commit (98d5382) due to manual redeploy of stale deployment — resolved by pushing a clean commit
- Git committer email (`ddandrea@threadology.dev`) not linked to GitHub account — updated `git config user.email` to `dill10dill@gmail.com`; force-pushed amended commit so Vercel could associate committer with GitHub user
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel had spaces and `.env.local` appended due to paste error — corrected to clean JWT value
- Updated `.env.local` to use JWT anon key (replacing old `sb_publishable_*` format key)

### Security Audit
- No hardcoded credentials in any source file
- `.env.local` properly gitignored; only `.env.local.example` committed
- Supabase anon key correctly uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (safe for client exposure)
- No service role key used anywhere in the codebase
- RLS policies enforce ownership on all four tables and storage bucket
- Auth enforced at middleware level and via `requireUser()` in all server actions/pages

### Notes
- Omitting `Co-Authored-By` Claude trailer from all commits — Vercel free (Hobby) plan treats co-authors as team members and blocks deploys

---

## [2026-04-02] — Font & Build Fix

### Changed
- `app/layout.tsx` — replaced raw `<link>` Google Fonts tags with `next/font/google` imports (`DM_Sans`, `Cormorant_Garamond`, `IBM_Plex_Mono`); removed Geist Sans local font; CSS variables renamed to `--font-dm-sans`, `--font-cormorant`, `--font-ibm-plex-mono`
- `tailwind.config.ts` — updated `fontFamily` entries to use new CSS variables (`var(--font-dm-sans)`, `var(--font-cormorant)`, `var(--font-ibm-plex-mono)`)

### Fixed
- Removed unused `setEntryState` helper from `components/vault/photo-upload.tsx` that was causing an ESLint `no-unused-vars` build error
- `npm run build` now passes cleanly with zero errors or warnings

### Notes
- Vercel "custom fonts not added in _document.js" warning was caused by raw `<link>` tags in JSX; resolved by using `next/font/google`
- `next/font/google` correctly exports `Cormorant_Garamond`, `DM_Sans`, `IBM_Plex_Mono` in Next.js 14.2.35 (earlier `node -e require()` test was a false negative — ESM module not resolvable via CommonJS)

---

## [2026-04-02] — README

### Changed
- Replaced the default create-next-app README with a project overview covering what Threadology does, the tech stack, project structure, getting-started steps, and database/storage schema summary
